Flower Recognition Program Using Machine Learning: Project from Naresuan University Demonstration School

1. Overview:
  This project presents a machine learning–based flower recognition program developed by students from Nawarat University Demonstration School.
  The goal is to enable users—students, teachers, and the public—to identify the names of various flowers found around the school campus through an easy-to-use program.

2. Objectives:
  Develop a program that can recognize and identify flower species found within the school using machine learning.
  Evaluate the accuracy and performance of the developed program.

3. Scope:
  3.1 Development Tools:
    PictoBlox – Used for programming and user interface implementation.
    Teachable Machine – Used to create a machine learning model.

  3.2 Model Data:
    Six types of flowers photographed from the school environment during the late rainy–early winter season were used for training:
    1. ชบา (ชื่อวิทยาศาสตร์: Hibiscus rosa-sinensis)
    2. ลั่นทม หรือ ลีลาวดี (ชื่อวิทยาศาสตร์: Apocynaceae)
    3. ทองอุไร (ชื่อวิทยาศาสตร์: Tecoma stans)
    4. พุุทธน้ำบุตร (ชื่อวิทยาศาสตร์: Gardenia carinata Wallich)
    5. กระดังงา (ชื่อวิทยาศาสตร์: Cananga odorata)
    6. พู่ระหง (ชื่อวิทยาศาสตร์: Hibiscus schizopetalus)

  3.3 Study Period: May 2025 – January 2026
  3.4 Location: Naresuan University Demonstration School
  3.5 Methodology
    3.5.1 Tools Used
      Flower recognition program built with Teachable Machine and PictoBlox
      Performance evaluation form for testing program efficiency
    3.5.2 Development Process
      Research information about six selected flower species.
      Study model training methods and programming with PictoBlox.
      Capture and prepare flower images for training with Teachable Machine.
      Train the model to recognize flower types.
      Write PictoBlox scripts to integrate the trained model.
      Test, evaluate, and refine the model’s accuracy.
    3.5.3 Data Collection & Analysis
      Conducted tests to measure accuracy and user satisfaction.
      Used statistical tools (mean calculation) to evaluate performance metrics.

4. Expected Outcomes
  1. A functional machine learning–based flower recognition program tailored for educational use.
  2. Quantitative results showing the program’s accuracy in flower identification.
  3. Promotion of AI and STEM learning through practical implementation.
